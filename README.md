Identified Trends:
1.Application Source Impact:
LinkedIn and Facebook are the top sources of applications, with LinkedIn leading significantly.

Older graduates (before 2000) are much less represented.

3.Current Status Distribution:
Approved applications make up the largest portion (over 50%).
A substantial number of applications have "No Status" or are in the "Reject" category, indicating a significant drop-off at certain stages.

4.Token Payments:
There’s a high correlation between token payments and approval status, suggesting that those who make a payment are more likely to get approved.

5.Industry Representation:
The majority of applications come from the Software Development and IT sectors, followed by Information Technology and Data Science.



Actionable Insights:

1.Optimize Marketing Channels:
Focus on LinkedIn and Facebook as primary channels for attracting applicants since they are the most effective.
Consider reallocating resources from less effective channels (e.g., Website and N-DB) to maximize ROI on marketing efforts.

2.Target Recent Graduates:
Tailor your messaging and program offerings to recent graduates, particularly those who finished between 2010 and 2020, as they make up the bulk of your applicants.
Consider developing alumni or refresher courses to attract older graduates, which could diversify your applicant pool.

3.Reduce Drop-Offs:
Investigate the reasons behind the large number of applications with "No Status" or "Reject." This could be due to a complicated application process or insufficient follow-up.
Implement automated reminders or a support team to help applicants complete the necessary steps to move from "No Status" to "Approved."

4.Enhance Token Payment Conversions:
Since making a token payment strongly correlates with approval, consider offering incentives for early token payments, such as discounts or guaranteed spots in programs.
Simplify the payment process or provide multiple payment options to increase conversions.

5.Leverage Industry Insights:
With the majority of applications coming from Software Development and IT, consider creating specialized programs or certifications that cater specifically to these industries.
Explore partnerships with companies in these sectors to offer tailored corporate training or upskilling programs, which could also drive enrollment.

By focusing on these areas, We can enhance the enrollment process, reduce drop-offs, and increase the overall conversion rate from applications to enrollments.
